Warning: This repository corresponds to an Eclipse workspace folder with two Eclipse projects.

This is the second version of the original Chess game develped by Marcel Soares Ribeiro and João Vitor Marques as a project for the discipline CES-22: Programação Orientada a Objetos (Object Oriented Programming), offered at ITA in the first semester of 2015. One of the requirements of this project was that it comprised some element of web design, hence the name. Ours meets this requirement by beeing playable over the Internet. This feature is further enhanced in the present version as a project for the discipline CES-35: Redes de Computadores (Computer Networks), offered at ITA in the second semester of 2016.
